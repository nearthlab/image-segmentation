    # updates are saved at the end of each epoch, so setting this to a
    # smaller number means getting more frequent TensorBoard updates.
    # Validation stats are also calculated at each epoch end and they
    # might take a while, so don't set this too small to avoid spending
    # a lot of time on validation stats.

    # If "backbone" is specified, the trainer will make all layers in backbone trainable.
    # Basically, if you specify other string, say "foo", the trainer will make all layers with the name beginning with `foo_`
    # In particular, if you are using one of resnets as backbone model,
    # you can specify the stages of backbone layers you want to train instead of just including "backbone"
